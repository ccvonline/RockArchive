[Rock RMS](http://rockrms.com/) 
===============================================================================
The [Spark Development Network](http://www.sparkdevelopmentnetwork.com/) is developing a first-class,
open source Relationship Management System (RMS) / Application Framework called *Rock*. While Rock specializes in serving the unique needs of churches it's useful in a wide range of service industries.  It's an ASP.NET 4.5 C# web application that
uses Entity Framework 6.0, jQuery, Bootstrap 3, and many other open source libraries.  We're
planning a beta release for early 2014.

Our main developer starting point site is [the wiki](https://github.com/SparkDevNetwork/Rock/wiki).
