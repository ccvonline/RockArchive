[Rock](http://rockchms.org/) - Rock is a People/Groups/Relationships & Church Management System
===============================================================================
The [Spark Development Network](http://www.sparkdevelopmentnetwork.com/) is developing a first-class,
open source Church Management System (ChMS) / Application Framework called *Rock*.  It's an ASP.NET 4.5 C# web application that
uses Entity Framework 6.0, jQuery, Bootstrap, and a whole bunch of other openly available libraries.  We're
planning a beta release for January 2014.

Our main developer starting point site is [the wiki](https://github.com/SparkDevNetwork/Rock/wiki).
