            Life was not meant to be lived alone. Gather weekly with people to build a community and impact it for the better. At CCV, Groups are vital to our church. They provide a sense of connection and security as we all tackle life together. Our Groups draw out the relevance of Biblical principles discussed in the weekend services.

        <p>
            For Christians, tithing (a word meaning ‘tenth’) is the starting point. Tithing is giving the first 10% of our income back to the local church. If you call CCV your home, we encourage you to give generously, knowing that your money is being used to support the mission of Jesus Christ – both here in the Valley, and around the world.
