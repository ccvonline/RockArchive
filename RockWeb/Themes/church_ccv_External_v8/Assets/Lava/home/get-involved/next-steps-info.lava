            Life was not meant to be lived alone. Gather weekly with people to build a community and impact your neighborhood for the better. At CCV, Neighborhood Groups are vital to our church. They provide a sense of connection and security as we all tackle life together. Our Neighborhood Groups draw out the relevance of Biblical principles discussed in the weekend services.

            Serving others is one of the most effective ways to live out your faith.

        </div>
        <p>
            For Christians, tithing (a word meaning ‘tenth’) is the starting point. Tithing is giving the first 10% of our income back to the local church. If you call CCV your home, we encourage you to give generously, knowing that your money is being used to support the mission of Jesus Christ – both here in the Valley, and around the world.
