            <p>
                Life was not meant to be lived alone. Gather weekly with people to build a community and impact it for the better. At CCV, Groups are vital to our church. They provide a sense of connection and security as we all tackle life together. Our Groups draw out the relevance of Biblical principles discussed in the weekend services.

            <h2>SERVE</h2>
            <p>
                Serving others is one of the most effective ways to live out your faith. In a world focused on personal gain, there is perhaps no greater way to show others what a life devoted to Christ is about. Sign up today and experience first-hand the impact our volunteer teams have on our local, national and international ministry.

            <h2>GIVE</h2>
            <p>
                For Christians, tithing (a word meaning ‘tenth’) is the starting point. Tithing is giving the first 10% of our income back to the local church. If you call CCV your home, we encourage you to give generously, knowing that your money is being used to support the mission of Jesus Christ – both here in the Valley, and around the world.
