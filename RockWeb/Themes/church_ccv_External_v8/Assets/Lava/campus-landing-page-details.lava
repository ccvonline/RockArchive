            <h3>ARRIVING FOR THE FIRST TIME</h3>
            <p>On your first visit, look for the designated New to CCV Guest Tables, where one of our team members will provide you with a Welcome Packet and answer any questions you may have.
               If you are checking in children, they will cover the first-time visit check-in process and lead you to your child's classroom. You'll want to arrive about 15-20 minutes early.
            </p>
            <h3>CHECKING IN KIDS & STUDENTS</h3>
            <p>Parents must check in their kids before service. Once your child is registered for the first time, simply enter your phone number into one of the self-service or assisted kiosks to receive your child's name tag. 
               You will receive a matching pick-up receipt which will be required to pick your child up after service. Jr High and High School Students are able to check themselves into class using the self-service kiosks.
