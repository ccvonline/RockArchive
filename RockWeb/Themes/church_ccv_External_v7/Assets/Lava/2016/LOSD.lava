      <h2>I Love My School</h2>
      <p>
        Did you know that Arizona ranks 47th in the nation for education? Right here in Arizona we have several schools performing below average. There are a lot of factors that impact this number, but what if I told you that there are simple things that we can do to help turn that number around? Imagine the impact that would could be made if over ten thousand of our CCV members met up on one day and served the 29 school districts in our community? That's exactly what we intend to do. With your help, we are going to complete over 200 projects at 170 schools around the valley in 2 weekends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Studies show that a clean and encouraging learning environment heightens student involvement in school activities, develops a sense of pride and ownership in the school, and increases students overall learning levels. By performing simple acts like cleaning, landscaping and writing notes of encouragement we can make our schools and neighborhoods a better place.
      </p>
      <h2>How To Get Involved</h2>
      <p>
        On Saturdays October 1st, (and October 8th in Peoria) we are asking you to engage in service projects across the valley to help schools in 3 specific ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Appreciation</li>
        <li>Cleanup</li>
        <li>Landscape</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Why We Chose This Initiative</h2>
      <p>
        You and your family are encouraged to choose a school, and then choose one of the three projects to serve on for the day. Each project has a group number limit, so if you want to serve together with your Neighborhood Group or Sports team, which we strongly encourage, be sure to pick your school together and sign up right away. If your first choice of school is filled, please pick another school that has open projects. We want to make sure as many projects get completed in these two weekends as possible.
      </p>
      <h2></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Serving is part of the DNA at CCV.</li>
        <li>Serving others is one of the most impactful ways to live out your faith and improve your community.</li>
        <li>Channeling our serving energy in one direction allows us to make a major impact on the education system in Arizona.</li>
        <li>Most of the needs/issues facing our communities are represented in our local schools (broken homes, hunger, abuse, etc.)</li>
      </ul>

            <dd>You do not have to join a group to serve, but serving together in a group is a lot more fun and meaningful. If you are ready to join a group, you can use your CCV mobile app to find a group, or visit our website at ccv.church/connect to find a group that meets near you. Most groups are open to new members throughout the year. Once you join a group, the Leader will reach out to you and let you know what service project they are performing. </dd>
