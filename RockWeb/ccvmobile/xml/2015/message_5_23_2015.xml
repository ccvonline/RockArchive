    <Q MarginTop="10%" Citation="Nicene Creed (325 A.D.)" Url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed">
        We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things visible and invisible. 
        And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father, Light of Light, 
        very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by 
        whom all things were made, who for us men, and for our salvation, came down and was 
        incarnate and was made man; he suffered and the third day he rose again, ascended into heaven; 
        from thence he shall come to judge the living and the dead. And in the Holy Spirit.
