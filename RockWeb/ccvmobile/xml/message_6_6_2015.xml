    <Q Citation="Jonah 1" Url="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jon.1" ChildAlignment="Center">The word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amittai: 
        &quot;Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before me.&quot;
        	But Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for Tarshish. He went down to Joppa, where he found a ship bound for that port. 
        After paying the fare, he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the Lord.
