				But be sure to fear the Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you.

			<Quote Citation="Philippeans 2:3-5">
				Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others. Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus.

			<Quote Citation="John 13:12-15">
				When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. &apos;Do you understand what I have done for you?&apos; he asked them. &apos;You call me &quot;Teacher&quot; and &quot;Lord&quot; and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you should also wash one another's feet. I have set an example that you should do as I have done for you.&apos;
