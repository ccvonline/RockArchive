			<h2>Neighborhoods</h2>
			<p>
				Life was not meant to be lived alone. Gather weekly with people from your neighborhood to build a community and impact it for the better. At CCV, neighborhood groups are vital to our church. They provide a sense of connection and security as we all tackle life together. Make neighborhood groups a priority by meeting weekly with those physically closest to you. Our neighborhood groups draw out the relevance of Biblical principles discussed in the weekend services.
